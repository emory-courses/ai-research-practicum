# Research Practicum in Artificial Intelligence

This is an advanced course in Computer Science that guides students to conduct innovative research in Artificial Intelligence (AI). 
The course expects students to have foundational skills in computing and apply them to deliver high-quality research through group projects. 
The main objectives are:

* To understand different areas of AI and state-of-the-art works in each field.
* To develop impactful ideas that are presentable to relevant research communities.
* To design sounding methodologies that are novel and intellectually intriguing.
* To perform experiments with thorough analyses that signify the importance of the research.

Students will work in teams, and each group will complete one research project towards the end of the semester. 
Successful research will be submitted to relevant conferences.
